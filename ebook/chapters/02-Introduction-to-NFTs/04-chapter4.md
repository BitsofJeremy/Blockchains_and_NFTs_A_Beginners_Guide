## What are NFTs?

> "NFTs represent a new paradigm of ownership and value, enabling the ownership of unique digital and physical assets on a blockchain." - Vitalik Buterin

NFT stands for "non-fungible token." Fungible means that something can be easily exchanged or replaced with something else that is the same. For example, $1 is fungible because you can exchange it for another $1 and it's still worth the same amount.

Non-fungible means that something is unique and cannot be easily exchanged or replaced with something else. For example, a signed baseball card is non-fungible because it is valuable because of the signature, and it is not the same as any other baseball card.

NFTs are digital tokens that represent ownership of something unique, such as a piece of art, a digital collectible, or a ticket to an event. They are stored on a blockchain, which is a type of digital ledger that keeps track of transactions and ownership.

One of the cool things about NFTs is that they can represent ownership of something that is purely digital, like a GIF or a tweet. This means that you can own something that exists only in the digital world, and you can prove that you are the owner with an NFT.

NFTs are starting to become really popular because they allow people to own and sell unique digital items, and they also make it easier to authenticate and track ownership of physical items like art or collectibles.

So, in summary, NFTs are unique digital tokens that represent ownership of something special and can be stored on a blockchain. They are like digital fingerprints that prove that you own something special and unique.
