## How do Blockchains Work?

> "Blockchain technology is like the internet in that it has a built-in robustness. By storing blocks of information that are identical across its network, the blockchain cannot be controlled by any single entity and has no single point of failure." - Don & Alex Tapscott

Now that you know what a blockchain is, let's talk about how it works.

When someone wants to make a transaction using a blockchain, they create something called a "block". A block is like a container that holds all the information about the transaction. It includes things like who is making the transaction, what they are exchanging, and when the transaction is happening.

When a block is created, it is sent to all the computers that store the information in the blockchain. These computers are called "nodes". The nodes check to make sure the information in the block is correct, and if it is, they add the block to the blockchain.

But here's the interesting part: the block that is added to the blockchain is not just the block with the new transaction. It is also all the previous blocks that have been added to the blockchain before it. So, the blockchain is actually a chain of blocks that are all connected together.

This is important because it makes the blockchain very secure. Since each block contains all the previous blocks, if someone tried to change something in an earlier block, it would change all the blocks that come after it. This would be very easy to notice, because the information in the blocks wouldn't match up anymore.

So, to sum it up, a blockchain works by adding new blocks to the chain that contain information about transactions. The blocks are checked by nodes to make sure the information is correct, and if it is, they are added to the chain. The chain is made up of all the previous blocks, which makes it very secure.
