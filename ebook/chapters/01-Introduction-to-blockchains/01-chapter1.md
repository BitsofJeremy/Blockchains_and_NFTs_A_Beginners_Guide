## What is a Blockchain?

> "The blockchain is an undeniably ingenious invention â€“ the brainchild of a person or group of people known by the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto." - Marc Andreessen

Have you ever heard of something called a "database"? It's a special kind of computer program that stores lots of information in an organized way. For example, a library might use a database to keep track of all the books they have, who has borrowed them, and when they are due back.

A blockchain is a special kind of database that is used to store information about transactions. Transactions are things like buying something with money, or exchanging one thing for another. For example, if you go to a store and buy a toy with your allowance money, that's a transaction.

What makes a blockchain different from a regular database is that it is decentralized, which means it doesn't have one central location where all the information is stored. Instead, the information is spread out and stored on many different computers all around the world.

This is important because it makes the information in a blockchain very hard to change or delete. If someone tried to change or delete something in a blockchain, they would have to change it on all of the different computers that store the information. And since there are so many computers, it would be almost impossible to do this without anyone noticing.

So, a blockchain is like a special kind of database that is used to store information about transactions and is very hard to change or delete. It is decentralized, which means it is spread out and stored on many different computers all around the world.
