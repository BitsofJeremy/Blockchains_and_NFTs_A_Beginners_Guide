## Types of blockchains (public, private, permissioned, etc.) *

> "There are three types of blockchains: public, private, and consortium. Public blockchains are open to anyone, private blockchains are restricted to a specific group of people, and consortium blockchains are a hybrid of the two." - Richard Brown

There are different types of blockchains, and each one has its own set of rules and characteristics. Let's take a look at some of the different types of blockchains:

**Public blockchains**: These are blockchains that anyone can use and contribute to. They are open to the public, and anyone can create a block or participate in the network as a node. Examples of public blockchains include Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Private blockchains**: These are blockchains that are only accessible to a specific group of people or organizations. They are not open to the public, and only certain people or organizations are allowed to create blocks or participate in the network as nodes. Private blockchains are often used by companies or other organizations to store sensitive information that they don't want to be publicly available.

**Permissioned blockchains**: These are blockchains that are somewhere in between public and private blockchains. They are not completely open to the public, but they are not completely closed off either. Instead, only certain people or organizations are allowed to create blocks or participate in the network as nodes, but anyone can view the information in the blockchain. Permissioned blockchains are often used by organizations that want to share information with each other, but still want to keep control over who can contribute to the network.

**Hybrid blockchains**: These are blockchains that combine elements of public and private blockchains. They may have some parts that are open to the public, and other parts that are only accessible to certain people or organizations. Hybrid blockchains are often used by organizations that want to share some information with the public, but still want to keep other information private.

So, there are different types of blockchains, including public, private, permissioned, and hybrid blockchains. Each type has its own set of rules and characteristics, and is used for different purposes.
