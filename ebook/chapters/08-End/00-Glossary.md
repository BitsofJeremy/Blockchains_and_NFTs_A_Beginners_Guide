**Blockchain**: A digital system that is used to track and verify information or transactions. It uses a decentralized network of computers to store and maintain a shared record of information.

**Non-fungible token (NFT)**: A type of digital asset that represents something unique and cannot be replaced or exchanged for something else of equal value. NFTs are often used to represent digital art or collectibles.

**Public blockchain**: A blockchain that is open to anyone and is not controlled by a single entity.

**Private blockchain**: A blockchain that is controlled by a single entity, such as a company or organization.

**Permissioned blockchain**: A blockchain that is open to certain users, but requires permission to access or participate.

**Hybrid blockchain**: A blockchain that combines aspects of both public and private blockchains.

**Digital currency**: A type of currency that is stored and transferred electronically, without the need for physical cash. Examples of digital currencies include Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Supply chain management**: The process of tracking the movement of goods as they move through the supply chain, from the point of origin to the final customer.

**Identity verification**: The process of confirming the identity of an individual.

**Voting**: The process of choosing a leader or making a decision by casting a ballot.

**Ethereum**: A blockchain-based platform that is used for building and running decentralized applications. Ethereum is used for a variety of purposes, including the creation of NFTs.

**Decentralized**: A system that is not controlled by a single entity, but rather is distributed among a network of computers or users.

**Digital asset**: A type of asset that exists in digital form, such as a digital artwork or collectible.

**Fungible**: Something that is interchangeable and can be replaced or exchanged for something else of equal value.

**Node**: A computer or device that is connected to a blockchain network and helps to maintain the shared record of information.

**Hash**: A unique code that is generated based on the data contained in a block on a blockchain.

**Mining**: The process of verifying transactions and adding them to a blockchain, which often involves solving complex mathematical problems.

**Wallet**: A digital storage location for digital currencies or other assets.

**Smart contract**: A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.

**Consensus**: The process of reaching agreement among the nodes on a blockchain network about the state of the shared record of information.

**Digital signature**: A type of electronic signature that is used to verify the identity of the sender and the authenticity of a message or document.

**Cryptography**: The practice of securing communications and information through the use of codes and algorithms.

**Peer-to-peer (P2P)**: A system in which two or more computers or devices communicate and interact directly with each other, without the need for a central server or authority.

**Decentralized application (DApp)**: A type of software application that is built on a decentralized platform, such as a blockchain.

**Immutable**: Something that cannot be changed or altered.

**Distributed ledger**: A digital record of transactions or other information that is maintained and shared among a network of computers or devices.

**Merkle tree**: A data structure used in blockchains to verify the integrity of data and to efficiently track changes to the data.

**Genesis block**: The first block in a blockchain.

**Block height**: The number of blocks in a blockchain, starting with the genesis block as block 0.

**Orphan block**: A block that is not part of the longest chain on a blockchain, and therefore is not included in the main record of transactions.
