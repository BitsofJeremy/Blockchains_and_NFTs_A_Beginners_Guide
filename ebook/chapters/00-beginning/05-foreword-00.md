# Foreword

Blockchains and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are two of the most talked-about technologies of the past decade, and for good reason. These innovations have the potential to revolutionize the way we do business, interact with each other, and even think about ownership and value.

In this book, JÃ¶rg expertly guides the reader through the complex world of blockchains and NFTs, demystifying these technologies and explaining their potential applications in a way that is accessible and engaging. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced technologist, you will find something valuable in these pages.

I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about blockchains and NFTs, and how these technologies are shaping the future. It is a must-read for anyone looking to understand and participate in the digital revolution that is happening all around us.
